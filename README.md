# Circos
Circos is a circular ideogram layout used to represent relationships between genomic intervals. Initialization of RCircos.Core.Components. ?RCircos.Reset is the command. Plot.Parameters will show you how to change the core components. Initialization of RCircos.Core.Components. ?RCircos.Reset is the command. Plot.Parameters will show you how to change the core components. Some labels will not be plotted. Type RCircos. Get.Gene.Name. Plot.Parameters() can be used to determine the number of labels for each chromosome.
